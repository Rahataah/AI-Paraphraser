# 🤪 The Utterly Bamboozling Text Paraphraser 🤪

## 🚀 Live Demo
[Try the app here](https://ai-paraphraser.streamlit.app)

Welcome to the most spectacularly underwhelming, mind-numbingly pointless text paraphraser ever to grace the digital universe! This flibbertigibbet of an application will take your perfectly good sentences and transform them into slightly different, occasionally comprehensible gobbledygook!

## 🌟 Whimsical Features

- **Discombobulation Engine**: Turns your eloquent prose into wackadoodle word salad!
- **Kerfuffle-Free Interface**: So simple, even your pet rock could use it!

## 🚀 How to Use This Malarkey

1. Get your openrouter API and paste it in the text box [get free keys from openrouter](http://openrouter.ai/)
2. Type your normal, boring text in the box
3. Smash that "Paraphrase" button with reckless abandon
4. Marvel at the hodgepodge of barely-related words that appear!

## 🧠 Technical Mumbo Jumbo

This app runs on the state-of-the-art gemma-3-12b model, which, unlike an actual parrot, doesn’t just mindlessly repeat what you say. Instead, it scrambles, twists, and remixes your words like a hyperactive DJ at a robot dance party. Think of it as an AI-powered game of telephone—except the last person in line is a very enthusiastic, slightly unpredictable poet!


## ⚠️ Warning

Side effects may include:
- Spontaneous giggling
- Raised eyebrows
- Confusion
- Existential questions about language itself
- The urge to show your friends how ridiculous technology can be

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:
- The dictionary, for containing so many words we could misuse
- Caffeine, for fueling this preposterous creation
- You, for having nothing better to do than use this app

*Remember: When life gives you words, make word-salad!*
